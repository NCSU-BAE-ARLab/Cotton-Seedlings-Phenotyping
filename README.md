## Trad Top Clean and Setup
trad_top_clean_and_setup.py uses the code from Trad Top Clean to clean the Trad Top point clouds. Additionally, it creates a new Trad Top folder that houses the original Trad Top point cloud and its filtered version. In this folder is also where the individual seedling cuts can be put.
